-- Simulate how a set of IAM policies and optionally a resource-based
-- policy works with a list of API operations and Amazon Web Services
-- resources to determine the policies\' effective permissions. The
-- policies are provided as strings.
--
-- The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the
-- authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the
-- operations. You can simulate resources that don\'t exist in your
-- account.
--
-- If you want to simulate existing policies that are attached to an IAM
-- user, group, or role, use SimulatePrincipalPolicy instead.
--
-- Context keys are variables that are maintained by Amazon Web Services
-- and its services and which provide details about the context of an API
-- query request. You can use the @Condition@ element of an IAM policy to
-- evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies
-- require for correct simulation, use GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy.
--
-- If the output is long, you can use @MaxItems@ and @Marker@ parameters to
-- paginate the results.
--
-- For more information about using the policy simulator, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html Testing IAM policies with the IAM policy simulator>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.

-- | An ARN representing the Amazon Web Services account ID that specifies
-- the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in

-- owner of any @ResourcePolicy@ included in the simulation. If the
-- @ResourceOwner@ parameter is not specified, then the owner of the
-- resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the
-- identity provided in @CallerArn@. This parameter is required only if you
-- specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is
-- different from the account that owns the simulated calling user
-- @CallerArn@.
--
-- The ARN for an account uses the following syntax:
-- @arn:aws:iam::AWS-account-ID:root@. For example, to represent the
-- account with the 112233445566 ID, use the following ARN:

-- | A list of ARNs of Amazon Web Services resources to include in the
-- simulation. If this parameter is not provided, then the value defaults

-- the response. You can simulate resources that don\'t exist in your
-- account.
--
-- The simulation does not automatically retrieve policies for the
-- specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the
-- simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the
-- @ResourcePolicy@ parameter.
