-- -   Delivery Timed Out: The command wasn\'t delivered to the managed
--     node before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts don\'t
--     count against the parent command\'s @MaxErrors@ limit, but they do
--     contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or
--     Incomplete. This is a terminal state.
--
-- -   Execution Timed Out: The command started to run on the managed node,
--     but the execution wasn\'t complete before the timeout expired.
--     Execution timeouts count against the @MaxErrors@ limit of the parent
--     command. This is a terminal state.
--
-- -   Failed: The command wasn\'t run successfully on the managed node.
--     For a plugin, this indicates that the result code wasn\'t zero. For
--     a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for one or
--     more plugins wasn\'t zero. Invocation failures count against the
--     @MaxErrors@ limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.
--
-- -   Cancelled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This
--     is a terminal state.
--
-- -   Undeliverable: The command can\'t be delivered to the managed node.
--     The node might not exist or might not be responding. Undeliverable
--     invocations don\'t count against the parent command\'s @MaxErrors@
--     limit and don\'t contribute to whether the parent command status is
--     Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.
--
-- -   Terminated: The parent command exceeded its @MaxErrors@ limit and
--     subsequent command invocations were canceled by the system. This is
--     a terminal state.
