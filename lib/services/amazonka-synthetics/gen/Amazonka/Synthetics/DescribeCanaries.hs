-- This operation returns a list of the canaries in your account, along
-- with full details about each canary.
--
-- This operation supports resource-level authorization using an IAM policy
-- and the @Names@ parameter. If you specify the @Names@ parameter, the
-- operation is successful only if you have authorization to view all the
-- canaries that you specify in your request. If you do not have permission
-- to view any of the canaries, the request fails with a 403 response.
--
-- You are required to use the @Names@ parameter if you are logged on to a
-- user or role that has an IAM policy that restricts which canaries that
-- you are allowed to view. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Restricted.html Limiting a user to viewing specific canaries>.
