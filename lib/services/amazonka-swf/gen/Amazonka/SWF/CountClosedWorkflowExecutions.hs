--
-- Returns the number of closed workflow executions within the given domain
-- that meet the specified filtering criteria.
--
-- This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and
-- may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.
--
-- __Access Control__
--
-- You can use IAM policies to control this action\'s access to Amazon SWF
-- resources as follows:
--
-- -   Use a @Resource@ element with the domain name to limit the action to
--     only specified domains.
--
-- -   Use an @Action@ element to allow or deny permission to call this
--     action.
--
-- -   Constrain the following parameters by using a @Condition@ element
--     with the appropriate keys.
--
--     -   @tagFilter.tag@: String constraint. The key is
--         @swf:tagFilter.tag@.
--
--     -   @typeFilter.name@: String constraint. The key is
--         @swf:typeFilter.name@.
--
--     -   @typeFilter.version@: String constraint. The key is
--         @swf:typeFilter.version@.
--
-- If the caller doesn\'t have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
-- or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the
-- action fails. The associated event attribute\'s @cause@ parameter is set
-- to @OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED@. For details and example IAM policies, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows>
-- in the /Amazon SWF Developer Guide/.
