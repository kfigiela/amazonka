--
-- Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server binary
-- files. Game server binaries must be combined into a zip file for use
-- with Amazon GameLift.
--
-- When setting up a new game build for GameLift, we recommend using the
-- Amazon Web Services CLI command
-- __<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html upload-build>__
-- . This helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build
-- files from a file directory to a GameLift Amazon S3 location, and (2) it
-- creates a new build resource.
--
-- The @CreateBuild@ operation can used in the following scenarios:
--
-- -   To create a new game build with build files that are in an Amazon S3
--     location under an Amazon Web Services account that you control. To
--     use this option, you must first give Amazon GameLift access to the
--     Amazon S3 bucket. With permissions in place, call @CreateBuild@ and
--     specify a build name, operating system, and the Amazon S3 storage
--     location of your game build.
--
-- -   To directly upload your build files to a GameLift Amazon S3
--     location. To use this option, first call @CreateBuild@ and specify a
--     build name and operating system. This operation creates a new build
--     resource and also returns an Amazon S3 location with temporary
--     access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your
--     build files to the specified Amazon S3 location. For more
--     information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html Uploading Objects>
--     in the /Amazon S3 Developer Guide/. Build files can be uploaded to
--     the GameLift Amazon S3 location once only; that can\'t be updated.
--
-- If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a unique
-- build ID and places it in @INITIALIZED@ status. A build must be in
-- @READY@ status before you can create fleets with it.
